# Web Development Learning Journey Repository

Welcome to my Web Development Learning Journey Repository! This repository serves as a documentation of my progress in learning web development and showcases some of the projects I've worked on. I'm excited to have you here.

## Folders

**JavaScript**

In the `javascript` folder, I've completed as part of my journey to master JavaScript. These files somewhat demonstrate my understanding of the language.

**Projects**

The `Projects` folder contains the simple web development projects I've undertaken. Feel free to explore the project folders to see my work and check out the source code.

**Web Development**

The `WebD` folder contains codes that I've accumulated during my web development learning journey.

## Contributions and Feedback

I welcome contributions, suggestions, and feedback from fellow developers and learners. If you have any recommendations, want to collaborate on a project, or have questions about any of my work, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Happy Coding!
